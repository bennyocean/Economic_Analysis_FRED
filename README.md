# Introduction
Dedicated project on Economic Data Analysis with Fred & Python to discover insights from unemployment and participation rates in the US job market.

Check the detailled analysis out here: [Economic_Analysis_FRED folder](/)

Based on the Economic Data Analysis project created by [Rob Mulla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R67XuYc9NQ4). See also the [Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/robikscube/economic-analysis-with-pandas-youtube-tutorial/notebook)

# Background
Driven by my quest to become a professional data scientist, this project helped me to reinforce my Python skills for data analysis, particularly, scraping, cleaning, exploring, and visualizing economic data.

Data is retrieved from Federal Reserve Economic Data, [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), an online database consisting of hundreds of thousands of economic data time series from scores of national, international, public, and private sources.

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the econimic data analysis of the US job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python** 
- **Jupyty Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **APIs**
- **Github**

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.

### 1. Pull & Clean Data
To clean and manipulate the unemployment rate data from the US job market, I filtered the monthly, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for all states. Then, I concatonated the different data by looping overy every state and removed non-relevant columns and NANs. To adjust the title column, I replaced some text and applied list comprehension to rename column names.

```python
# pull monthly, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for all states in percent
unemp_df = fred.search('unemployment rate state', filter=('frequency','Monthly'))
unemp_df = unemp_df.query('seasonal_adjustment == "Seasonally Adjusted" and units == "Percent"')
unemp_df = unemp_df.loc[unemp_df['title'].str.contains('Unemployment Rate')]

# get unemployment rates for all ids and concatonate them in one dataframe
all_results = []

for myid in unemp_df.index:
    results = fred.get_series(myid)
    results = results.to_frame(name=myid)
    all_results.append(results)
    time.sleep(2.2) # Don't request to fast and get blocked
uemp_results = pd.concat(all_results, axis=1)

# drop non relevant columns
cols_to_drop = []
for i in uemp_results:
    if len(i) > 4:
        cols_to_drop.append(i)
uemp_results = uemp_results.drop(columns = cols_to_drop, axis=1)

# create new dataframe (uemp_states) and drop NANs. Also replace 
uemp_states = uemp_results.copy()  #.drop('UNRATE', axis=1)
uemp_states = uemp_states.dropna()

# Mapping id to state name by removing verbose text "Unemployment Rate in " in the title's column
id_to_state = unemp_df['title'].str.replace('Unemployment Rate in ','').to_dict()

# list comprehension to rename column names using id_to_state dictionary with mapped state names for each id 
uemp_states.columns = [id_to_state[c] for c in uemp_states.columns]
```
Here's the breakdown of the unemployment rate in the US job market from 1976 to 2024:
- **Wide Unemployment Range:** Unemployment rate ranges from 1.7% to 24.7% during that period, with an average of 5.9% over all states.
- **Corona Peak:** 
- **Outlier State:**

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT	
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
